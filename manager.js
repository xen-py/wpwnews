Whyte Avenue is another popular hangout spot for friends, with a variety of shops, restaurants, and bars. If you\'re interested in arts and culture, the Royal Alberta Museum is an excellent destination for spending time with friends, featuring exhibits on the history and culture of Alberta. The Old Strathcona district is another popular spot with a great atmosphere, home to a variety of restaurants, bars, and shops, as well as a farmer\'s market and several festivals throughout the year. Another fun spot for friends to hangout would be to explore the food scene, trying out different and unique restaurants or even food trucks on Whyte Avenue or 124 street.</p>')

This year\'s World Cup had fans crying and cheering, and many supposedly "easy games" for some countries ended with the underdogs winning. The World Cup finals were one of, if not the, craziest matches in football history. Argentina had the lead 2-0 with Messi and Di Maria both scoring until the 80th minute when Kylian Mbappe scored a penalty, and then in the next minute, he scored another goal. During extra time, Messi was able to score one more goal, but shortly after Kylian Mbappe scored his third, making it a hat trick. It ended up being 3-3 and the game went to penalties. Argentina scored four times when France only scored twice, which finally closed the goat discussion. Messi is officially the Goat.</p>')
